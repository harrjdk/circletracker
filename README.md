# circletracker
A really rough script to track circles with some minimal buckets/simple memory.

## How to run
```
python app.py
```

## Requirements:
* opencv2-python
* numpy

## Features:
* "Don't-call-it-intelligence" circle tracking (look for similarly colored circle centers when picking a circle)
* Tons of dead code

## Troubleshooting
This is an extremely rough PoC just to throw together an idea of how to track a semi-uniform circle/sphere. This isn't meant for production, this is barely meant for fun.
